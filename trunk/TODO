roadmap:
--------

* finish the c preprocessor (variadic macros)
* make the ccroot class a link class with hooks, move the c/c++ support into the hooks
* improvement of the configuration system -> rule-based system
* move common configuration flags into the globals to make env smaller - see issues 23 and 86

ideas to watch:
---------------

* wrappers to make adding new construction rules more user-friendly (not really started)
* precompiled headers support (pch)
* cross-compilation helpers (need specs)
* packaging (rpms, debs)
