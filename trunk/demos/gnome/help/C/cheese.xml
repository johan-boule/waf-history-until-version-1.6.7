  for the <systemitem>GNOME desktop</systemitem>
  </para>

<section id="using">
  <title>Usage</title>
  <para>
    The main screen of &app; looks like the screen shot below
  </para>

  <figure>
  <title>&app; screenshot</title>
    <screenshot>
      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </screenshot>
  </figure>

  <para>
    &app; defaults to photo mode, and needs to be changed to video mode if
    desired.
  </para>

  <section id="using-effects">
    <title>Effects</title>
    <para>
      To apply effects to the input of your webcam, click
      the button labelled Effects. When you go to the
      effects window, you will see a window similar to the image below
      <figure>
        <title>&app; effects screenshot</title>
        <screenshot>
          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>

          </mediaobject>
       </screenshot>
      </figure>

    </para>
    
    <para>
      You are able to select numerous effects to apply to your photo. To apply
      an effect, just click on the name or image above, and the button will turn
      to a blue shade. Selecting multiple effects will apply all the effects to
      your image (for example, if you apply “Hulk” and “Horizontal Flip”, the
      input from the webcam will be altered to have a green shade and be up side down).
    </para>
  </section>
  
  <section id="using-photomode">
    <title>Photo Mode</title>
    <para>
      Photo mode is the default mode that &app; opens in. When not in photo mode,
      click the button labelled “Photo” or press Alt – P to change to photo mode.
      Photo mode will take a single photo every time the button labelled “Take a
      photo” or the Spacebar is pressed, and will save to disk.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="using-videomode">
    <title>Video Mode</title>
    <para>
      Video mode is a mode that allows you to take short videos using the webcam.
      When not in video mode, click the button labelled “Video” or press Alt – V to
      change to video mode. Video mode will start recording a video every time the
      button labelled “Start Recording” or the Spacebar is pressed. The video will stop
      recording and save to disk when the button labelled “Stop Recording”
      or the Spacebar is pressed.
    </para>

    <para>
      The video mode does look any different to the screen shot of photo mode,
      except that the button labelled “Take a photo” will be either “Start Recording”
      or “Stop Recording” (depends if you are currently recording or not),
      and the button labelled “Video” is greyed out, whereas the button
      labelled “Photo” is not.
    </para>

<section id="working-with">
  <title>Working with photos and videos</title>
  <section id="takingaphoto">
    <title>Taking a photo</title>
    <para>
      To take a photo in &app;, be sure to be in “Photo” mode. 
    </para>

    <para>
      To take a photo, apply the effects that you wish by clicking the button
      labelled “Effects”, click on the effects desired as described in a previous section
      and press the button labelled “Back”. You should now have the effects that
      you clicked on applied to the webcam input.
    </para>

    <para>
      To take the photo, press the button labelled “Take a photo”. You will then
      see &application; count down from 3. At the end of the count, your entire screen
      will flash white, and the photo that was just taken will appear in the photo
      stream at the bottom of the program window.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="recordingavideo">
    <title>Taking a video</title>
    <para>
      To take a video in &app;, make sure that the “Video” button has been pressed
    </para>

    <para>
      To start recording a video, press the button labelled “Start Recording” or press the Spacebar.
      The time of how much video has been recorded will appear in the bottom right
      hand corner.
    </para>

    <note>
      <para>
        If your video appears to be jerky or have a low
        frame rate (only updating the picture every few seconds), it does not mean
        that the original recording is also of bad quality. It has probably a more 
        constant and higher frame rate than what you see.
        To stop recording, press the button labelled “Stop Recording”.
        The video recorded will appear in the photo stream at the bottom of the program.
      </para>

      standard “Save File” dialog that will allow you to rename the photo if desired
      and save to any location you wish.

  <section id="faq-sluggish">
    <title>The video is sluggish/has a slow response. What can I do?</title>
    <para>
      You may have set "ximagesink" ("X Window System (No Xv)") as video-output.
      This means, that your cpu is doing all the work. Change it to "xvimagesink"
      ("X Window System (X11/XShm/Xv)") in order to let your graphics card do the work.
    </para>

    <para>
      To change the settings, run "gstreamer-properties", click the Video tab
      and change the appropriate settings.
    </para>

  <section id="faq-mac">
    <title>I have a Mac with iSight and a ATI graphics card, and the colors are weird.</title>
    <para>
      This is a problem with the ATI graphics card, though there is a work around.
      Change the video-output to custom and insert the following: "ffmpegcolorspace !
      video/x-raw-yuv,format=(fourcc)YV12 ! ffmpegcolorspace ! xvimagesink".
    </para>

    <para>
      To change the settings, run "gstreamer-properties", click the Video tab

    <title>My webcam works with gstreamer, but does not work with &application;. What's wrong?</title>
    <para>
      Using "gstreamer-properties" mentioned in the above question, try changing from
      xvimagesink to ximagesink or vice-versa. If this still does not work run "cheese --verbose" on
      the command line and copy the logging into a bug report in our

  <section id="faq-supported-webcams">
    <title>Which cameras are supported</title>

      &app; uses gstreamer for video grabbing. So in principle &app; supports
