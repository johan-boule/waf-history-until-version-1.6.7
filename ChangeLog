* Node: find_build -> find_or_declare
* Node: find_source -> find_resource
* Node: find_resource_lst, find_or_declare_lst, ensure_dir_node_from_path_lst, find_dir_lst disappear
* Runner: Runner.exec_command -> Utils.exec_command
* Runner: Runner.printout -> bld.printout
* Remove m_ from all variables
* installation api simplification
* remove the configuration cache
* the -k behaviour was restored (keep running after errors)
* new interfaces for custom error handling
* new interfaces for reordering the tasks before executing them (scheduling constraints)
* modification of the installation system: use foo.install_path = '${PREFIX}/bin' instead of inst_var and inst_dir
* Configure.Configure -> Configure.ConfigurationContext
* Build.Build -> Build.BuildContext
* detect the amount of cpus automatically
* preprocessor improvements (implicit include paths)
* configuration api refactoring (c/c++)
* The Waf binary size has been reduced by 25%
