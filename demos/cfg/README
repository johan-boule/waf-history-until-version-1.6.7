PROJECT CONFIGURATION DEMO

The goal is to design a configuration system for a huge project containing several interdependant modules.
In practice each folder (src1, src2 and src3) would have lots of subfolders themselves.

The sub-groups are identified:
* src1 needs a simple configuration with GCC
* src2 contains some ocaml source files
* src3 contains some code which relies on a library

The following constraints are given:
* src1 is always compiled
* src2 is only visited if objective caml is found
* src3 is only visited if objective caml is found and if another library is detected

Additionally, the modules src2 and src3 requires additional flags to specify on the command-line:
--where-is-lib=path and --where-is-ocaml=path

The demo is not finished yet :)
