        You have to change the dpms suspend mode gnome-power-manager uses.
        Open gconf-editor, and then change the keys 
        <literal>/apps/gnome-power-manager/ac_dpms_sleep_method</literal> and
        <literal>/apps/gnome-power-manager/battery_dpms_sleep_method</literal>
        to one of the modes that work, e.g. standby, suspend or off.
