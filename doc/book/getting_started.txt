== Getting Started

=== Obtaining Waf

The Waf project is located on http://code.google.com/p/waf[Google Code].
The current Waf version requires an interpreter for the Python programming language such as http://www.python.org[cPython] 2.3 to 3.1 or http://www.jython.org[Jython] >= 2.5. Note that Waf requires http://docs.python.org/library/bz2.html[bzip2] compression support, which may be unavailable in self-compiled cPython installations.

==== Using the Waf binary

The Waf binary does not require any installation whatsoever. It may be executed directly from a writeable folder. Just rename it into \'waf' if necessary:

[source,shishell]
---------------
$ wget http://waf.googlecode.com/files/waf-1.5.15
$ mv waf-1.5.15 waf && chmod 755 waf
---------------

==== Generating the Waf binary from the source code

The Waf binary creation requires a Python interpreter in version 2.4 to 2.6. The source code is processed to support Python 2.3 and Python 3.

[source,shishell]
---------------
$ wget http://waf.googlecode.com/files/waf-1.5.15.tar.bz2
$ tar xjvf waf-1.5.15.tar.bz2
$ cd waf-1.5.15
$ ./waf-light --make-waf
---------------

=== Running Waf

The 'waf' script can be used directly from a writeable folder:

[source,shishell]
---------------
$ ./waf
---------------

Or, if the executable permissions are not set properly:

[source,shishell]
---------------
$ python waf
---------------

The 'waf' file has its own library compressed in a binary stream in the same file. Upon execution, the library is uncompressed in the current directory, in a hidden folder that will be re-created if removed. The naming enables different Waf versions to be executed from the same folders:

[source,shishell]
---------------
$ ls -ld .waf*
.waf-1.5.15-2c924e3f453eb715218b9cc852291170
---------------

By default, the recommended Python interpreter is cPython, for which the supported versions are 2.3 to 3.1. For maximum convenience for the user, a copy of the http://www.jython.org[Jython] interpreter in the version 2.5 may be redistributed along with a copy of the Waf executable.

NOTE: A project containing 'waf', 'jython2.5.jar' and the source code may be used almost anywhere.

WARNING: The 'waf' script must reside in a writable folder to unpack its cache files.

=== Installing Waf on a system

Installing Waf on a system is unnecessary and discouraged:

. Interpreter version: unlike the 'waf' file, the installed version will not run on Python 3
. Operating systems: Waf cannot be installed on Windows (yet)
. Installation: installation is cumbersome, and requires administrative privileges
. Waf versions: users rarely install the appropriate software version (too old, too new, bugs)
. Bugs: projects may depend on unspecified behaviour in particular Waf versions
. Size: the 'waf' file is small enough to be redistributed (about 80kB)

Installation require a Python interpreter in the versions 2.4 to 2.6. It may require administrator or root privileges, depending on the target folder (prefix).

[source,shishell]
---------------
# ./waf-light configure --prefix=/usr/
# ./waf-light install
---------------

Likewise, Waf can be uninstalled using:

[source,shishell]
---------------
# ./waf-light --prefix=/usr/
# ./waf-light uninstall
---------------
