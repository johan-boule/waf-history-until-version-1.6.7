		<title>Quick tarball creation</title>
		<para>
			Creating a tarball of the project is as simple as running
			<programlisting language="sh">
$ waf dist
Your archive is ready -> cpp_test-0.0.1.tar.bz2
			</programlisting>
			By default, the archive name uses the version and the project name found in the top-level wscript file
			<programlisting language="python">
VERSION = '0.0.1'
APPNAME = 'cpp_test'
				</programlisting>
			</para>

			<para>
			The default compression format is <ulink url="http://www.bzip.org/">bzip2</ulink>. It may be changed to <ulink url="http://www.gzip.org/">gzip</ulink> by using the following code:
				<programlisting language="python">
import Scripting
Scripting.g_gz = 'gz'
				</programlisting>
			</para>

		<title>Custom archives</title>
		<para>
			Custom archives can be created by providing a function named "dist" in the top-level script file. The following example prints a checksum immediately after the archive is created:
			<programlisting language="python">
VERSION = '0.0.1'
APPNAME = 'cpp_test'

def dist():
    import md5
    from Scripting import dist
    (f, filename) = dist(APPNAME, VERSION)
    f = file(filename,'rb')
    m = md5.md5()
    readBytes = 100000
    while (readBytes):
        readString = f.read(readBytes)
        m.update(readString)
        readBytes = len(readString)
    f.close()
    print filename, m.hexdigest()
    sys.exit(0)
			</programlisting>
		</para>

		<para>
			A function may be defined for excluding or adding more files to the archive. The hook is executed from the temporary directory after the dist function has finished to run:
			<programlisting language="python">
def dist_hook():
	os.remove('foo.txt')
			</programlisting>
		</para>

		<para>
			When copying the files, the dist function automatically excludes temporary files. The function dont_dist in the module Scripting does the filtering, the code is reproduced below:
			<programlisting language="python">
excludes = '.svn CVS .arch-ids {arch} SCCS BitKeeper .hg'.split()
dist_exts = '~ .rej .orig .pyc .pyo .bak config.log .tar.bz2 .zip Makefile Makefile.in'.split()
def dont_dist(name, src, build_dir):
    global excludes, dist_exts

    if (name.startswith(',,')
        or name.startswith('++')
        or (src == '.' and name == Options.lockfile)
        or name in excludes
        or name == build_dir
        ):
        return True

    for ext in dist_exts:
        if name.endswith(ext):
            return True

    return False
			</programlisting>
			To exclude new files, it is possible to modify the extensions, or to provide a new method <emphasis>dont_dist</emphasis>, for example, to disable most of the filtering:
			<programlisting language="python">
import Scripting
def dont_dist(name, src, build_dir):
	if (name == build_dir or (src == '.' and name == Options.lockfile)):
		return True
	return False
			</programlisting>
		</para>
	</section>

	<section id="cleaning">
		<title>Cleaning the project tree</title>
		<para>
			By default, all the files produced by Waf are produced into the build directory. An additional file named <emphasis>.lock-wscript</emphasis> is created to store information on the build directory:
			<programlisting language="sh">
build/
.lock-wscript
			</programlisting>
			The command <emphasis>waf distclean</emphasis> removes these two elements from the filesystem. Afterwards, it is necessary to recompile the project again.
		</para>


		<para>
			To remove the build files without removing the configuration, use the command <emphasis>waf clean</emphasis> instead. The files created in the build directory may be removed manually, but the modifications will not be detected by Waf.
		</para>
