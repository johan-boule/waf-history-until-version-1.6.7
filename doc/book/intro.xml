		<para>Waf does not need to be installed. There are many advantages of not installing Waf, among them:
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>Waf is very small (80kB)</listitem>
				<listitem>Different projects use different Waf versions, it is better to ship the script for users</listitem>
				<listitem>The latest Waf version might change and the users would complain</listitem>
			</orderedlist>
			To generate the Waf script from the sources, use the following command:
			<programlisting language="sh" linenumbering="numbered">
			$ ./waf-light --make-waf --strip
			</programlisting>
			Once the waf script is generated, you may redistribute it freely (bsd licence)
		</para>

		<title>Waf installation (2)</title>
		<para>
			If you really want to install the Waf application on the system (despite the advantages enumerated in the previous section), you may use the following command on unix-like systems such as Linux:
			<programlisting language="sh" linenumbering="numbered">
			# ./waf-light install --prefix=/tmp/
			</programlisting>
			Root priviledges may be required depending on the final location.
