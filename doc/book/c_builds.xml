		<title>The Waf preprocessor</title>
		<para>
			Waf uses a preprocessor written in Python for finding the headers on which the source files depend. By default the preprocessing is limited to the files present in the project. To enable the preprocessor to find system headers, use the following code:
			<programlisting language="python">
import preproc
preproc.go_absolute = 1
			</programlisting>
