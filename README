WHAT YOU WILL FIND HERE
-----------------------

A python script named "Waf"
It is used to help building software (it is also called a "build system"):
 * detect configuration variables
 * compile source files
 * install programs and libraries

Numerous examples for various programming languages can be found in the folder demos/

GENERATE WAF
------------

Run './waf-light --make-waf' to generate waf or look at './waf-light --help'
Then try 'waf --help', there are predefined targets for waf itself.

The waf script generated can be redistributed freely along with
your projects. This saves time looking for the right waf version.

If you want to install waf system-wide (discouraged), use:
./waf-light install --prefix=/some/install/dir

Though Waf is maintaining compatibility for Python 2.3, the script used for
generating Waf requires Python 2.4

The resulting script can be reduced further by using the option --strip
./waf-light --strip --make-waf

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------

WAFLOCK: name of the lock file (default: .lock-wscript)
WAFDIR: path to the wafadmin folder (developers must set it)
WAFCACHE: path to the target cache (replaces --usecache)
NOCOLOR: set to 1, disables the waf coloring output

QUICK HOWTO
-----------

Starting a new project with waf:
  Copy the 'waf' script to your project.

  Add sources in a subdirectory (this is how programs are built in real life), and a wscript on the top-level.

Using waf:
  To begin with, have a look at the cpp demo first (demos/cpp):
  * configure with "waf configure"
  * compile with "waf"
  * install with "waf install"
  * create a tarball with "waf dist"
  * clean with "waf distclean"

Creating scripts:
  * The wscript are actually python modules, from which functions with particular namings
  are imported: init, shutdown, configure(conf), build(bld) and set_options(opt)
  * The mandatory functions are configure(conf), build(bld) and set_options(opt)

DEVELOPERS
----------

Developers must set WAFDIR instead of regenerating waf all the time.

PACKAGERS
---------

By default, waf uncompresses itself into its current directory (.waf-version-rev)
The destdir is of course taken into account: "DESTDIR=/tmp/stuff waf install"

SUGGESTED USAGE
---------------

Do not rely on command-line defines, generate a config.h file instead.
Avoid includes having ".." in the path as system headers and folders out
of the project directory could be scanned (can be slow).

LIMITATIONS
-----------

A few assumptions are used over the user projects, for some they are features and for others these are limitations:
  * all sources and headers are located in a source directory
  * all files produced are put into a separate build directory (do not put the .o files among the sources)
  * source file names and folders names do not contain spaces
    (waf should work anyway, but this is not a priority)
  * waf does not constantly watch if source files have changed (they are considered once when the build starts)

NEW IN WAF 1.4
--------------

* various optimizations
* bugfixes
* new feature system for adding methods dynamically
* export_incdirs will add the folders when linking against libraries given in uselib_local
* the type 'plugin' disappears, the c/c++ types are staticlib,program,shlib
* simplification of the configuration modules (gcc, g++, ..)
