WHAT YOU WILL FIND HERE
-----------------------

An experimental project called 'waf'
Examples can be found in demo/
Tests can be found in wafadmin/ (run ./Test.py and look at the folder wafadmin/test/)

Try 'waf --help' too, there are predefined targets for waf itself.

HOW TO RE-USE THE CODE
-----------------------

Run 'waf dist' first to generate a clean archive, and copy the result to the folder of your project.
Have a look at the DESIGN file for the functions and members to provide in wscript modules,
and imitate the cpp demo.
