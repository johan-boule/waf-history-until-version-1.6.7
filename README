WHAT YOU WILL FIND HERE
-----------------------

An experimental project called 'waf'
Examples can be found in demo/
Tests can be found in wafadmin/ (run ./Test.py and look at the folder wafadmin/test/)

Try 'waf --help' too, there are predefined targets for waf itself.

HOW TO RE-USE THE CODE
-----------------------

Run 'waf dist' first to generate a clean archive, and copy the result to the folder of your project.
Your project will need to provide two scripts: 'sconfigure' and 'sconstruct'
The file sconfigure must contain functions to call, which are:
* custom_options to provide additional options and help for the command-line
* detect(env) to create the main cache file for the project (copies of the environment can be made afterwards)

WARNING: the configuration system is not finished
