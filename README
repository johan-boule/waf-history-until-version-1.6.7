WHAT YOU WILL FIND HERE
-----------------------

The development version of Waf.

It requires python 3

Most of the work is on the data structure at the moment
The current code will not build anything


- the build context instance will initialize itself with the srcdir and output directory specified in the lockfile
- there are no variants anymore
- think about a consistency check to disable nodes if the parent is not a child of srcnode
