roadmap:
--------

* configuration system improvements (cross-compilation helpers)
* improve the filesystem representation (the pickle file is too big)
* improve the custom compilation rules (pc file creation, etc)
* more gnome support
* provide installation threads

ideas to watch:
---------------

* precompiled headers support (pch)
* packaging (rpms, debs)
