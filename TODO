Waf 1.6
-------

General

- refactor the environment thing
- unification uselib / uselib_local / objects -> attribute 'uses'? / subsystems
  new global variable uselib_vars and generalization of uselib for all kinds of task generators
- enable different scripting systems without changing too much code
- support for // configurations
- better apis for shell compilation in Task.py
- enable a Vigor-like mode to print suggestions (i.e. no task generators => print warnings, no build dir => print warnings)

Potential sub-projects (contributions will be welcome)

+ IDE file generator (msvc, codeblocks)
+ CMake file interpreter
+ multiprocess for distributed compilation (vs threads?)
+ autoconf-like configuration library?

Docs
- show a complete example of c compilation with rules vs task generator code (procedural vs object-oriented)
