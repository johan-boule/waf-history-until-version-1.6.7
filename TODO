roadmap:
--------

* move the benchmarking helpers and other tweaks into a separate module (Weak.py) - and fix it

* improvements of the c preprocessor (features)
* improvement of the configuration system (started)
* wrappers to make adding new construction rules more user-friendly (not really started)

ideas to watch:
---------------

* precompiled headers support (pch)
* cross-compilation helpers (need specs)

* make the ccroot class a link class with hooks, move the c/c++ support into the hooks
* move common configuration flags into the globals to make env smaller
* refactor the apis

* packaging (rpms, debs)
* improve the scons emulation
* ncurses options menu support

Qt4.py: do not hash the moc files in the signature
