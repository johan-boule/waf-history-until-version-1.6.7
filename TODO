roadmap:
--------

* improve the filesystem representation (the pickle file is too big)
* the find_dir/find_source/find_build apis are doing too many things at the same time
* improve the custom compilation rules (pc file creation, etc)
* more gnome support
* more java support
* cross-compilation settings gcc,linux->win32

ideas to watch:
---------------

* precompiled headers support (pch)
* packaging (rpms, debs)
* provide installation threads
